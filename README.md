##modern-ie-vagrant
Based on the virtual machine images released with the [Modern.IE project](http://dev.modern.ie/), modern-ie-vagrant makes testing IE easier with help from [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com). The machine images in modern-ie-vagrant are based on the original images with the addition of activating WinRM to make them compatible with the [Vagrant WinRM communicator](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/vagrantfile/winrm_settings.html).

##Prerequisites

modern-ie-vagrant requires [Oracle Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) be installed and in your path.

##Usage

To list the available virtual machines

```bash
vagrant status
```

To start a new virtual machine

```bash
vagrant up IE10-Win7
```

To start multiple virtual machines at once

```bash
vagrant up IE11-Win7 IE10-Win7 IE9-Win7 IE8-Win7
```

##Available Vagrant Boxes

* Edge-Win10
* IE10-Win7
* IE10-Win8
* IE11-Win10
* IE11-Win7 
* IE11-Win8.1
* IE6-WinXP
* IE7-Vista
* IE8-Win7
* IE8-WinXP
* IE9-Win7

##Known Issues
Windows XP VMs do not support WinRM. Therefore, when trying to start these boxes Vagrant will hang while trying to connect. The VM starts and is usable, but the commandline will not return until the machine is shut down. The error from Vagrant can be safely ignored.
